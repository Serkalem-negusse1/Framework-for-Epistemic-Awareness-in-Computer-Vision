# Epistemic Awareness in Computer Vision: A Call for Critical Deep Learning

This repository implements a framework for **Epistemic Awareness** in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, directly adopting the logic of "Epistemic Racism" mitigation strategies from anti-doping research.

##  The Problem: Epistemic Racism in AI

As highlighted in Ruwuya et al. (2025), epistemic racism is a system that privileges Western perspectives while marginalizing non-Western knowledge. In Computer Vision, this manifests as:

* **Provincial Universalism**: Assuming models trained on Western datasets have "universal relevance".


* **Stereotyping as Logic**: Models inadvertently reinforcing racial ideologies by treating marginalized groups as "outliers" or "primitive" contexts.


* **Institutional Exclusion**: A lack of representation from the Global South in defining the "success" and "accuracy" metrics of a model.



##  Implementation Features

This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) that moves beyond standard "bias-fixing" toward systemic critical awareness.

### 1. Data Provenance & Diversity Auditing

We implement auditing tools to detect when knowledge production is dominated by Western institutions (often exceeding 90% in standard benchmarks). This addresses the "lack of representation" that leads to biased understanding.

### 2. Epistemic Equity Metrics

Instead of simple accuracy, we calculate **Epistemic Equity**. This identifies if the model displays a "credibility deficit" toward specific demographics, ensuring that errors do not reinforce existing racial stereotypes.

### 3. Epistemic Friction

The code includes "Friction" check-points designed to challenge the assumption that research (or algorithmic output) is "objective and neutral," which can be a mask for underlying bias.

##  How to Use

1. **Open the Colab Notebook**: Launch the provided `.ipynb` file.
2. **Reflexive Practice**: Users are encouraged to maintain a "Reflexive Journal" while labeling data to address internalized worldviews.


3. **Adaptive Methodologies**: Use the included `Race-Based Methodology` scripts to shift thinking away from normative, hegemonic frameworks.



##  Call for Critical Awareness

This project is an intentional effort to address the "subtle yet pervasive" form of racism in knowledge production. We advocate for:

* **Increased Inclusion**: Ensuring research participants and their communities have a voice in the process.


* **Diversified Leadership**: Prioritizing scholars from developing countries to lead studies and model design.


* **Challenging the Status Quo**: Rejecting the "one size fits all" approach that fails to account for diverse cultural and economic contexts.
